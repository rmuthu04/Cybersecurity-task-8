# Cybersecurity-task-8

## 🔒 Objective
To understand how VPNs protect privacy and secure communication by changing IP addresses, encrypting traffic, and masking real user locations.

---

## 🧰 Tools Used
- **VPN Tool:** ProtonVPN (Free Tier)
- **System:** MacBook Air (M1, macOS Sequoia 15.4)
- **Browser:** Google Chrome
- **Website Used:** [https://whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com)

## ⚙️ Steps Followed

1. **Created a Free Account**
   - Registered a ProtonVPN Free account using my email.

2. **Installed the VPN**
   - Downloaded *macOS Ventura or later* version from [ProtonVPN Downloads](https://protonvpn.com/download).
   - Installed the app and logged in successfully.

3. **Connected to a VPN Server**
   - Selected a **Tokyo, Japan** server from the ProtonVPN Free list.
   - Connection established successfully.

4. **Verified IP Change**
   - Checked IP using [whatismyipaddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com):
     - **Before VPN:** India (Airtel ISP) — *Hidden for privacy.*
     - **After VPN:** Japan (DataCamp Limited VPN Server)

5. **Disconnected VPN**
   - Compared browsing speed and IP change before and after.

## ✅ Benefits of VPN
- Encrypts all network traffic.
- Masks IP and hides user location.
- Provides secure browsing on public Wi-Fi.
- Prevents ISP tracking and data logging.

---

## ⚠️ Limitations
- Slight reduction in internet speed.
- Free servers have limited countries.
- Does not provide full anonymity.

---

## 🔧 Protocol Used
**OpenVPN** protocol with **AES-256 encryption** (ProtonVPN default).

---

## 📚 Learning Outcome
- Understood VPN encryption and tunneling.
- Verified IP and location masking.
- Learned the role of VPNs in protecting online privacy.
